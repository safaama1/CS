# Mesirot Game :large_blue_circle: 
The game consists of two or more participants and a cue ball.<br/>
All the participants in the game stand in a circle and face the other participants. One of them holds the ball in his hand and must throw it to one of the other participants of his choice. The participant who received the ball passes it to another participant (or to the participant from whom he received the ball, depending on his choice) and so on. The person who fails to catch a thrown ball is eliminated from the game, and the person who remains last is declared the winner.<br/>
The game starts with an initial number of players (the number is set in the constructor), one player is randomly selected to start passing the ball, and each time one player is randomly selected to pass the ball.<br/>
The number of players is determined before the game starts, as well as the playing time.<br/>
